# Getting error reading the Markdown, Syntax error in graphmermaid version 8.14.0.

It sounds like you're encountering a syntax issue with the Mermaid code when rendered with version 8.14.0. Older versions of Mermaid can sometimes be more sensitive to certain syntax, especially with node IDs or complex labels.

The most common cause for a generic "Syntax error in graph" in older versions, when the syntax otherwise looks correct, can be non-standard characters in node IDs. In the previous diagram, the node ID `Final 종합Report` contained a Korean character. While modern Mermaid is generally good with Unicode, specific versions or renderers might struggle with non-ASCII characters in identifiers.

Here's a revised version of the Mermaid code. The primary change is renaming `Final 종합Report` to `FinalConsolidatedReport` to use only ASCII characters for the node ID. The label (the text displayed) can still be descriptive.

```markdown
```

graph TD
UserInput[User Input: Code Requirement \& Language] --> Orchestrator(OmniCoder Orchestrator);

    subgraph Code Generation and Static Analysis Loop
        direction LR
        Orchestrator --> DevAgent_Initial(Developer Agent Node - Initial Code Generation);
        DevAgent_Initial -- Generates Initial Code --> GeneratedCodeV1[Generated Code Artifact v1];
        GeneratedCodeV1 --> StaticAnalysisAgent{Static Analysis Agent Node (Utilizing Knip-like/SCAST Capabilities for C#)};
        StaticAnalysisAgent -- Identifies Unused Code, Dependencies, Redundancies --> StaticAnalysisReport[Static Analysis Report];
        
        subgraph RefinementStep
            direction TB
            StaticAnalysisReport --> DevAgent_Refine(Developer Agent Node - Code Refinement);
            GeneratedCodeV1 ----> DevAgent_Refine; % Developer Agent also takes original code for context
            DevAgent_Refine -- Eliminates Redundancies, Applies Fixes --> RefinedCode[Refined Code Artifact v2];
        end
    end
    
    subgraph Multi-Perspective Review and Analysis
        direction LR
        RefinedCode --> ReviewerAgent{Reviewer Agent Node (Reviewer LLM)};
        ReviewerAgent -- Review Feedback --> ReviewReport[Review Report];
        
        RefinedCode --> SecurityAgent{Security Agent Node (Security LLM)};
        SecurityAgent -- Security Issues Found --> SecurityReport[Security Report];
        
        RefinedCode --> PerformanceAgent{Performance Agent Node (Performance LLM)};
        PerformanceAgent -- Performance Analysis --> PerformanceReport[Performance Report];
    end
    
    subgraph Final Quality Assessment and Output
        direction TB
        QualityAgent{Quality Agent Node (Quality LLM)};
        RefinedCode ----> QualityAgent;
        StaticAnalysisReport ----> QualityAgent; 
        ReviewReport ----> QualityAgent;
        SecurityReport ----> QualityAgent;
        PerformanceReport ----> QualityAgent;
        QualityAgent -- Aggregates Feedback, Generates Final Score --> FinalConsolidatedReport[Final Consolidated Report & Quality Score];
        FinalConsolidatedReport --> OutputFile[Report Saved: code_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md];
    end
    ```
```

**Key Change:**

* Node ID `Final 종합Report` has been changed to `FinalConsolidatedReport`.

**Tips for Mermaid 8.14.0 Compatibility:**

* **Node IDs:** Stick to alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores for node IDs. Avoid spaces, special characters, or non-ASCII characters in IDs.
* **Labels:** While labels (the text displayed on nodes or edges) are more flexible, extremely long labels or complex nested punctuation might sometimes cause issues in older renderers. The current labels should generally be fine.
* **Simplicity:** If errors persist, try simplifying the diagram (e.g., removing a few nodes/edges or a subgraph) to isolate the problematic part.

This revised code should have a higher chance of rendering correctly in Mermaid 8.14.0. If you still encounter issues, the error message itself (if more specific than "Syntax error in graph") or the line number indicated would be helpful for further diagnosis [^1].
