Below is an improved high-level design for OmniCoder, incorporating a dedicated Static Analysis Agent Node, inspired by tools like Knip or SCAST [^4], to specifically address tasks such as identifying unused files, dependencies, and redundant functionalities. This agent acts after initial code generation and before the broader review phases, allowing the Developer Agent to refine the code based on static analysis findings.

The Mermaid diagram illustrates this enhanced workflow:

**Explanation of Improvements and Flow:**

1. **User Input \& Orchestration:** The process starts with the user providing a code requirement and the programming language to the OmniCoder Orchestrator.
2. **Initial Code Generation:** The Orchestrator tasks the `Developer Agent Node` to generate an initial version of the code (`Generated Code Artifact v1`).
3. **Static Analysis Integration:**
    * The `Generated Code Artifact v1` is then passed to a specialized `Static Analysis Agent Node`. This agent incorporates capabilities similar to Knip (for JS/TS) or SCAST (which supports C\# [^4]).
    * This agent performs static analysis, focusing on identifying unused files, dependencies, exports, and other forms of code redundancy, as per the user's request ("Scan <codebase> to identify and eliminate any now-redundant functionalities"). Static analysis tools typically work by parsing code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to understand its structure and relations [^1][^4].
    * The output is a `Static Analysis Report` detailing these findings.
4. **Code Refinement:**
    * The `Static Analysis Report` and the `Generated Code Artifact v1` are fed back to the `Developer Agent Node` (or a dedicated refinement sub-agent).
    * The Developer Agent uses this report to *eliminate* the identified redundancies and apply other suggested improvements, producing a `Refined Code Artifact v2`. This creates a tighter feedback loop for code quality early in the process [^1].
5. **Multi-Perspective Review:** The `Refined Code Artifact v2` then proceeds to the specialized review agents, as in the original design:
    * `Reviewer Agent Node`: For general code review.
    * `Security Agent Node`: For identifying security vulnerabilities.
    * `Performance Agent Node`: For analyzing performance characteristics.
Each of these agents produces its respective report.
6. **Final Quality Assessment:**
    * The `Quality Agent Node` receives the `Refined Code Artifact v2` and all reports: `Static Analysis Report`, `Review Report`, `Security Report`, and `Performance Report`.
    * It aggregates this information to produce a `Final Consolidated Report & Quality Score`. This aligns with multi-agent systems where a supervisor or aggregator synthesizes information from specialized agents [^2][^6].
7. **Output:** The final report is saved.

This improved design introduces a dedicated step for deep static analysis early in the workflow, enabling the system to proactively address code bloat and maintainability issues before extensive reviews. The separation of the Static Analysis Agent allows for specialized tooling and LLM focus, enhancing the system's capability to deliver lean and maintainable code.
